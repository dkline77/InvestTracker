# InvestTracker
Personal Finance Tracking Application

## Goals

The goal of this application is to build my own investment tracker to track investments across sealed items and cards across MTG. The problem this application solves is financial transparency for collectible, non-digitized investment units.

## Structure

The Application should read a .csv file of an excel investment tracking sheet and output an investment dashboard with realtime data scraped from online marketplaces and price-tracking hubs.
